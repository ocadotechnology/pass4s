# Localstack

If you want to use pass4s for SNS/SQS messaging, your usual first step is to set up local development environment. [Localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/) is a toolkit provided by Amazon to replicate AWS locally. This section provides ready-to-use localstack setup using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Docker compose setup

To launch localstack simply copy the snippet below and save it locally as `docker-compose.yml`. Once that's done, open terminal, navigate to the place where you saved the file and run `docker-compose up`. Your setup is ready to go.

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: localstack_main
    image: localstack/localstack
    hostname: localhost.localstack.cloud
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"            # LocalStack Gateway
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"  # external services port range
    environment:
      - DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
      - SERVICES=sqs,sns
      - EAGER_SERVICE_LOADING=1
      - SKIP_SSL_CERT_DOWNLOAD=1
      - HOSTNAME_EXTERNAL=localhost.localstack.cloud
    volumes:
      - "/tmp/localstack:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
  
  setup-resources:
    image: localstack/localstack
    environment:
      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AWSSECRET
      - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-2
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c
    command: >
      "
        sleep 15
        alias aws='aws --endpoint-url http://localstack:4566'
        # Executing SNS
        aws sns create-topic --name local_sns
        # Executing SQS
        aws sqs create-queue --queue-name local_queue
        # Subscribing to SNS to SQS
        aws sns subscribe --attributes 'RawMessageDelivery=true' --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:eu-west-2:000000000000:local_sns --protocol sqs --notification-endpoint arn:aws:sqs:eu-west-2:000000000000:local_queue
        aws sqs get-queue-url --queue-name local_queue
        # Create na S3 bucket for large messages
        aws s3 mb s3://large-messages
      "      
    depends_on:
      - localstack
```

## Resources

This setup comes with batteries included, meaning it not only does set up the service, but also some basic resources for you to play with. The provided resources are:

 - Topic `local_sns` to write your messages onto
 - Queue `local_queue` to read messages from
 - Subscription between the two, making the messages from `local_sns` to be pushed to `local_queue`
 - Bucket `large-messages` in case you want to use [s3 proxy](modules/s3proxy)

Please notice how for queue creation we use `--attributes 'RawMessageDelivery=true'`. This is done intentionally, make sure to use this attribute with your production setup to avoid communication issues. We add this because we don't want AWS to try interpreting our JSON message contents. To find out more check out https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-large-payload-raw-message-delivery.html
